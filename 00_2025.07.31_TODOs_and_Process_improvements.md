TODO: **FIX PROBLEMS** with Python syntax and indentation formattting in the displayed questions and answers. Make sure that the Pygments highlighter is used correctly too.   

Here's  examples of incorrect formatting :  

    Question:

    What is the output of the following snippet?

    x = 1 y = 2 z = x x = y y = z print(x, y)


    Question:

    What is the output of the following snippet if the user enters two lines containing 3 and 6 respectively?

    x = input() y = int(input()) print(x * y)

# # TODO: Fix Problems with proper validation of question and answer selection types.  Validate that the answers have the correct HTML selection control type given for each answer. 

    The following question has 2 answers (i.e., checkboxes) and a radio button control was given, making it impossible to select 2 answers.  

        Question:

        Which of the following variable names are illegal? (Select two answers)

# ######  TODOs: added on 8/19/2025 #############################

    TODO: Rename QUIZ-TEST Data Files to be Consistent: 
        One problem we can see is that the input data files do not have "exam"  in their file name.   Some QnA raw data is in "quiz" files, and others are in files with "test" in the name. Recognize files with "test", "quiz", and "exam". It must also capture the source filename, for each input file. 

    TODO: Make sure the database records for tests and quizzes MATCH the actual tests and quizzes, section, names, and data from the actual PCEP exams on Edube.org: 

        https://edube.org/study/catalog/python-essentials-2-aligned-with-pcep-30-02/my-progress


    TODO: (INSTRUCTIONS FOR COPILOT): It must also extract the unique "ID" and "name" from the input file for each quiz or test, and record ID and name values in the database. Here is a sample snippet to show the typical location to the key-value pair. Give me your plan for updating the converter and the database to handle these use cases.  Wait for me to review it and approve your plan.  

    TODO: Check the DEBUG: blocks to see if the "correct" answers are indeed correct. 
        "Debug: Question ID: 12, Type: single-select, Correct Index: 0

    TODO: Modify the answer selection process so that the user can click ANYWHERE within an bounding box to choose that answer, rather than requireing the user to click ONLY on the radio button or check box to select it.  (USABILITY)


    TODO: TEST SESSION MANAGEMENT NEEDS TO BE ADDED.  

    TODO: Adjust the Practice Exam DURATIONS to match the actual exam durations for the same number of questions.  See Python Institute.org  at https://edube.org/study/pe1 for more information. 

    TODO: UPdate the PRD to reflect the actual exam durations:  https://pythoninstitute.org/pcep 

        Exam Duration:	PCEP-30-02 â€“ Exam: 40 minutes, NDA/Tutorial: 5 minutes

        PCEP-30-01 â€“ Exam: 45 minutes, NDA/Tutorial: 5 minutes

        Number of Questions:	30

        Format: Single- and multiple-select questions, drag & drop, gap fill, sort, code fill, code insertion | Python 3.x

        Passing Score	70%


    TODO: **HIGH PRIORITY** Before Starting a new exam, give the user controls to select the exam practice SECTION (Module 1, 2, 3, 4, or Summary Test). Adjust the test duration accordingly. 

    ## TODO: (LOW PRIORITY) Add a page "About This Exam" that gives the test taker some background for the specific exam they are practicing for.  

    For the PE1 Exam:   https://edube.org/study/pe1

####  ADMIN GUIs for SYSTEM, USER, DATA Administration ##########

DATA ADMINISTRATION INTERFACE: 

TODO: Loading new exam data.  A User Interface to load data?  MVP 2.0  

TODO: USER ADMINISTRATION: 

TODO: Adding new test takers.

## USER DATA RESET?  
TODO: ??? Add a "RESET" button to let a user "Zero out" their progress and remove their individual test takers performance data.  ***BE CAREFUL WITH THIS!!

TODO: Add a "Backup" to export a user's test performance data before RESET their progress to zero??

TODO: Cleaning up the database:  WHAT OPERATIONS NEED CLEAN-UP ?  

    (check for duplicated QnA data?)  There should not be any duplicated data, ebcause it should be checked for duplicates at Data Import Time. 


## USER PERFORMANCE REPORTING
TODO: Add a Reporting Function to generate a PDF report??

# DONE 2025.07.29
    # DONE: Create new Github Repository for the "Rapid_Exam_Practice_System" project. This is the cleaned up version of the "PCEP_Rapid_Exam_App" project.

    # DONE:  Other NEXT tasks TBD:  **ALREADY DONE!!**
    - database is partially implemented and 20 QnA items have been imported.
    - exam converter has not been integrated and used to import ALL existing exams.  IT does not work for any NEW exams that are captured into the system.
