# Project Definition: AI-Powered Rapid Certification Exam Practice System

- Updated: 2025.06.12

## Project Name: AI-Powered Rapid Certification Exam Practice System

## Project and Work Product Description:
This project addresses the gap between traditional study methods and efficient exam preparation for the certification exams. The Rapid Certification Exam Accelerator is an offline practice exam tool that helps users cycle through practice exams very quickly, focusing on areas of weakness and maximizing study effectiveness. It solves the problem of inefficient studying by allowing users to burn down difficult questions and return to them later, providing immediate feedback, and tracking progress over time.

## Description of Solution:
The solution implements a Flask-based web interface that displays exam questions and answers extracted from HTML files containing practice exams. The system stores exam data in a local SQLite database for fast access and offline use, with a comprehensive schema designed to maintain data integrity. Users can select exams, practice specific topics, track their progress with visualizations, and use an embedded Python interpreter to test code in real-time. The MVP 1.0 will deliver core functionality, with multi-user features planned for later versions.

## Solution Design (high-level):

### System Development Process Plan:
1. **DEFINE**: Complete PRD (Product Requirements Document)
2. **DESIGN**: Create comprehensive Design Document
3. **DEVELOP**: Implement code according to prioritized requirements
4. **DEBUG**: Thoroughly test and debug all components
5. **DOCUMENT**: Create complete documentation for the system
6. **DELIVER**: Deploy final working system to GitHub

### Prioritized Requirements (MVP Approach):
1. Core exam data extraction and storage functionality
2. Basic web interface for practice exam sessions
3. Question navigation and session management
4. Performance tracking and basic reporting
5. Python code syntax highlighting and interpreter

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP):
1. Advanced performance visualization
2. Multi-user functionality and leaderboards
3. AI-powered question analysis and recommendations
4. Mobile responsive interface optimizations
5. Offline mode enhancements

### Solution Code Description (low-level design):
The system will consist of the following components:

1. **Data Extraction Module**:
   - Extract JSON exam data from HTML files
   - Process and validate question and answer format
   - Store in SQLite database with proper schema

2. **Web Interface Module**:
   - Flask-based UI for exam practice
   - Session management functionality
   - Code syntax highlighting using Pygments

3. **Exam Session Module**:
   - Timer and progress tracking
   - Question navigation and bookmarking
   - Answer submission and scoring

4. **Reporting Module**:
   - Performance statistics calculation
   - Data visualization using Matplotlib/Plotly
   - Export functionality for reports

5. **Utility Modules**:
   - Logging system with timestamped files
   - Error handling with informative messages
   - Database migration tools using Alembic

### Development Considerations:
- Ensure data integrity with unique IDs for questions and answers
- Use AI to verify and identify correct answers
- Properly categorize questions by topic, module, and difficulty
- Implement robust error handling and logging
- Use version control with version IDs in filenames
