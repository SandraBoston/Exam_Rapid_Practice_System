---

## 🚨 High-Risk Technical Debt

### 1. **Circular Import Resolution via Dependency Injection**
**Shortcut Taken:** Implemented dependency injection pattern to avoid fixing underlying circular import structure  
**Root Cause:** Models importing database, database importing models, converters importing both  
**Technical Debt:** Band-aid solution that masks architectural problem  
**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Symptoms:** Complex initialization, hard to test, potential for runtime failures  
**Proper Fix:** Restructure imports with proper separation of concerns, use factory pattern

### 2. **Database Path Environment Variable Workaround**
**Shortcut Taken:** Set `os.environ['DATABASE_URL']` with absolute path before app creation  
**Root Cause:** Flask app using relative paths that break when working directory changes  
**Technical Debt:** Environment pollution, non-portable solution  
**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Symptoms:** Production deployment issues, environment-specific bugs  
**Proper Fix:** Implement proper configuration management with config classes

### 3. **Manual Alembic Migration Creation**
**Shortcut Taken:** Created migration manually with hardcoded SQL statements  
**Root Cause:** Rushed to add new fields without proper migration workflow  
**Technical Debt:** Migration not generated from model changes, potential schema drift  
**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Symptoms:** Schema inconsistencies, migration conflicts in team environment  
**Proper Fix:** Use `alembic revision --autogenerate` with proper model definitions

## ⚠️ Medium-Risk Technical Debt

### 4. **Hardcoded Dashboard Statistics Replacement**
**Shortcut Taken:** Directly replaced hardcoded values with database queries in route handler  
**Root Cause:** Quick fix to show real data without proper service layer  
**Technical Debt:** Business logic mixed with presentation layer  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Symptoms:** Hard to test, difficult to maintain, performance issues  
**Proper Fix:** Create statistics service class with proper caching

### 5. **Production Import Script Path Manipulation**
**Shortcut Taken:** `os.chdir()` to src directory then fix imports with environment variables  
**Root Cause:** Import path confusion between project root and src directory  
**Technical Debt:** Working directory manipulation, fragile path dependencies  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Symptoms:** Script fails when run from different directories  
**Proper Fix:** Use absolute imports and proper Python package structure

### 6. **Enhanced Converter Model Injection Pattern**
**Shortcut Taken:** Pass model classes as dictionary to avoid import issues  
**Root Cause:** Circular import problem between converter and models  
**Technical Debt:** Complex initialization, tight coupling  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Symptoms:** Hard to extend, confusing interface  
**Proper Fix:** Use proper dependency injection container or factory pattern

## ⚡ Low-Risk Technical Debt

### 7. **Test File Organization by Moving**
**Shortcut Taken:** Moved test files to tests/ directory without restructuring  
**Root Cause:** Cluttered project root needed quick cleanup  
**Technical Debt:** Test files not properly integrated into test suite  
**Risk Level:** LOW  
**Symptoms:** Tests may not run automatically, poor discoverability  
**Proper Fix:** Organize tests by feature, create proper test suite structure

### 8. **Error Handling in Production Import**
**Shortcut Taken:** Basic try/catch with logging, continue on error approach  
**Root Cause:** Need to process as many files as possible quickly  
**Technical Debt:** Silent failures, inadequate error categorization  
**Risk Level:** LOW  
**Symptoms:** Hard to diagnose issues, potential data corruption  
**Proper Fix:** Implement error categorization, retry logic, transaction rollback

### 9. **Summary Calculation Bug in Import Script**
**Shortcut Taken:** Left summary showing 0 files while individual processing worked  
**Root Cause:** Focused on core functionality, ignored reporting accuracy  
**Technical Debt:** Misleading user feedback  
**Risk Level:** LOW  
**Symptoms:** User confusion, difficulty tracking progress  
**Proper Fix:** Fix result aggregation logic in summary calculation
