## CONVERSATION START

**Human:** I'm ready to continue with Task 6: "Set up SQLAlchemy ORM configuration" from the PCEP Implementation Checklist.

Key requirements for this task:
- Implement SQLAlchemy ORM configuration (Checklist: src/models/__init__.py, src/database.py)
- Use strict filename-based semantic versioning for documentation/config files, but not for files in src/ and subfolders
- Validate the SQLAlchemy setup by testing imports, table creation, and basic CRUD operations
- Update the checklist and changelog per semantic versioning rules
- Write a time-stamped progress report and a verbatim transcript of the conversation to the Code_Gen_Tracker folder
- Ensure all terminal commands are run in the activated pcep_env conda environment

Please start by examining the current project structure and the detailed design documents to understand what SQLAlchemy models and configuration we need to implement.

**Assistant:** I'll help you implement Task 6: SQLAlchemy ORM configuration. Let me start by examining the current project structure and the detailed design documents to understand what we need to implement.
